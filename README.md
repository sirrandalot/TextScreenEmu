# TextScreenEmu

TextScreenEmu is a java package which provides tools for emulating that old school text mode we all know and love (and sometimes hate).  
It provides a main `Screen` onto which characters from a `Tileset` can be drawn. The screen has a foreground and background colour which are set according to a `Palette`.  
  
Several tilesets and palettes are provided but you can make your own using the factory classes.  
  
Check out the wiki for more information!
